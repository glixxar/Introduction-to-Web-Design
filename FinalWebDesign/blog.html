                        <h2>Initial thoughts</h2>
                        <p id="content-p">Expectations were high, the first ever theme park built on the moon built by none other than Tesla with Elon Musk's son X Æ A-12 as a foray into the theme park business with 
                            Cheesetopia as its first child. Getting into the commercial spaceship the Tesla CX, I felt like a kid again waiting to open my present on Christmas morning
                            with my parents chiding me to wait. As I stared into the endless abyss of space, I felt elated to be one of the first chosen few to experience this theme park.

                        <h2>The Attractions</h2>
                        <p>
                            With the free estate available, the park spans the size of a small country and is situated in the center of the Moon's largest crater the South Pole Aitken basin. Each ride is crafted and thought out
                            and mindblowingly fun as they challenge conventional thought and utilise the Moon's low gravity to create new ways to assault your senses. For example, the UFO spinner literally detaches from its hinges 
                            to spin you around the Moon's atmosphere and then finally lands back again when the ride ends. The Cheesy Wet'n'Wild is a giant water ride with all the water replaced with cheese and before you get on they
                            provide you with a set of disposable clothes. After you are done they will hose you down with soap. The Centrifugal drop is a 100 meter tall plasteel contraption that goes up to its full height and drops 
                            you down with you struggling to catch your heart before you jumps out of your chest but don't worry though, the online consciousness backup machine you are restored to a new spare body to ensure you do not die permanently.

                        <h2>The Accomodation</h2>
                        <p>
                            The selection of hotels may be few, however they have spared no expense in making sure each hotel is unique and special. As I was given a chance to stay at all three hotels, I will begin by describing my experience 
                            at the Mini Terrarium. <br>First of all the person who named this hotel the Mini Terrarium should get his eyes checked as there is nothing 'mini' about this hotel. It is essentially a forest of trees enclosed within a giant glass bubble with
                            its denizens, the Amazonians, a warrior race of women operating the hotel. This hotel is great of single men who like their women big and strong. The room itself is intriguing as well with the open sunroof in the bedroom making me feel like I am falling asleep
                            in the jungle. The food has a very rustic feel to it makes you feel like you are back in time when we were still hunter-gatherers. <br>Next, the Aquarium Hotel is exactly as its name describes, a giant aquarium with a hotel built into it. Or was it the other way around ?
                            In terms of scale, it exceeds even the mini terrarium as they even have whales living in the aquarium, pretty unbelievable. With the amount of amneties and fun you can have here, you can take a break from all the cheese motifs back in the main park before returning. Food 
                            is excellent especially if you are seafood addict with everything you can imagine from the poisonous fugu to all the crabs you can eat. <br>Finally we have the Cheese Palace, this hotel is actually 4 different hotels built into one as the Forbidden Palace, Ziggurat and the Japanese Palace are 
                            secondary parts to the main hotel which provides guests the opportunity to live like royalty in four different ways. Each hotel room for each part differs greatly as they are built to different specifications and feature amneties unique to the style they were built in. For example, the Japanese
                            Palace features tatami mats and paper sliding doors while the main castle is a 1:1 recreation of the Buckingham Palace. Every guest is also provided their own personal butler for their needs. The food is also amazing as there are 24/7 buffets running for guests to dine to their delight.

                        <h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
                        <p>
                            To sum up my experience, this trip to Cheesetopia was everything I dreamed of and more with the next trip being on my calendar as there is so much of the park I have to explore as three weeks here evidently wasn't enough. Eventhough the tickets for the park is cheap at around $5000 for two weeks, there is a waiting list 
                            to get a ticket with people around the world vying for a chance. I hope my next trip here will be sooner than I think as I can't wait to lose my sense of time and self here again.
